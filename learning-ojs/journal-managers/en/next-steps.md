# Next Steps: Publishing Content and Extended Functionality
After configuring relevant settings, inviting key users, configuring your content access, customizing the design of your site, and learning how to communicate with users, you are ready to start thinking about getting content in your journal.

In this chapter, you can choose the next step of your journey with OJS. Each section will direct you to the guides and information that you will need to successfully publish your content.


## Learn the Editorial Workflow in OJS {#workflow}

OJS offers an editorial workflow for managing new submissions from submission to publication online. Any members of the Editorial Board working with submissions should take the time to get familiar with the stages and features of the workflow.

We also provide role-based guidance to support all participants in the publishing process:

[Learning OJS for Authors](../../author/)

Read them for yourself or distribute them to your journal’s community.


## Install and Enable Plugins to Add Functionality {#plugins}

OJS supports the use of plugins created by PKP and its community to further extend its functionality. Learning about plugins can help you connect with external services

You can read about the features available through plugins and how to enable them in our [Plugin Guide and Inventory](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/). Work with your Site Administrator to install plugins that will help you publish.
